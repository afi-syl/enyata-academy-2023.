let and const are both used to declare a variable in javaScript. variables decleared with 'let' are block-scope which means that they can only be accessible within the block code where they are defined while 'const' is also a block-scope like 'let' but they have additional characteristic where they remain constants, which mean that the value cannot be reassigned once defined or decleared. they are different from var because they are both block-scope but 'var'is a function-scoped or global scoped but not block-scoped, this means that var variables and accessible thropughout the entire function or global scope which they are declared.
In JavaScript, you can use a variable after you have defined it within the scope
To declare a string, you use double quotes. example "hello"
Yes you can use single or double quote to create a string and that will depend on your specific requirements but it is advisable to use the double quote yet both quote are functionally equivalet.
The "9" in a qoute is string while the 9 without the qoute is number and this are data types.
Declaration introduce a variable to the program's scope by specifying its type or existence.....Redeclaration is the act declaring a variable with the same name multiple times within the same scope.  ........Assignment is the act of giving a value to a variable that has already been declared or defined...... Reassignment occurs when a new value is assigned to a variable that already had a value. it update the existing variable with a new value.
